Abbey_Szyslak: Looks like this is the end.
Barney_Gumble: That's all right. I couldn't have led a richer life.
Barney_Gumble: So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!
Lisa_Simpson: I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick.
Barney_Gumble: Oh, that's sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too. (BELCH)

Abbey_Szyslak: Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk, homer.
Lisa_Simpson: Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk, homer.
Abbey_Szyslak: Oh, homer.
Abbey_Szyslak: What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time, homer.
Lisa_Simpson: He's just a little nervous. (PROUDLY) He has to give a speech tomorrow on "How To Keep Cool In A Crisis.", homer.


Homer_Simpson: (SOBS) What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Barney_Gumble: Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.
Homer_Simpson: Did it work?
Barney_Gumble: I'm a free man, ain't I?
Barney_Gumble: Whoa!
Barney_Gumble: Huh? A pretzel? Wow, looks like I pulled a Homer!
